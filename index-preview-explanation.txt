In this preview, I am showing a very preliminary preview of my first/home/landing page, 
or the website's index. In an HTML paragraph, I've included 3 hyperlinks to other pages: 
2D, 3D, and Digital. These are the divisions of my website which will eventually become 
clickable tabs on top of the page. When these hypertext links are clicked on, they lead the 
user to their respective pages. Right now, it is easy to see that the links are able to be 
clicked on because they are underlined as well as displayed in purple and blue. I have not 
yet included information on these landing pages. This is simply because most of the content 
on my website will be photographic images, which I have not gotten around to taking and editing. 
I am not sure if putting the hypertext links into paragraphs is the correct is thing it to do 
if I want the linked tabs to be ultimately displayed at the top of the page, but for now that 
is what I did. I am guessing that I can place them at the top of the page eventually through CSS.
Eventually, I will be adding either an artist's statement page or an about me page, and that page will 
be a clickable tab at the top of the website's home page as well. This is the area of my website
that will have the most about of text, most likely, because I want to minimize the amount of 
reading viewers' must do. Because most of my work is visual artwork, I want to have viewers tuned into just seeing
and observing, instead of having to spend a lot of time reading and processing textual information. 
I have not yet decided on an official color scheme, but I will probably stick to black and white 
in order to keep things looking clean and simple. I don't want a website design that will distract 
from the webpages' main content.
