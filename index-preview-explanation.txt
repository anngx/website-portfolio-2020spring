In this preview, I am showing a very preliminary preview of my first/home/landing page, 
or the website's index. In an HTML paragraph, I've included 3 hyperlinks to other pages: 
2D, 3D, and Digital. These are the divisions of my website which will eventually become 
tabs on top of the page. When these hypertext links are clicked on, they lead the user to 
their respective pages. I have not yet included information on the landing pages. This is 
simply because most of the content on my website will be photgraphs, which I have not gotten
around to taking and editing.
