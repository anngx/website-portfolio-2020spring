In this preview, I am showing a very preliminary preview of my first/home/landing page, 
or the website's index. In an HTML paragraph, I've included 3 hyperlinks to other pages: 
2D, 3D, and Digital. These are the divisions of my website which will eventually become 
tabs on top of the page. When these hypertext links are clicked on, they lead the user to 
their respective pages. I have not yet included information on the landing pages. This is 
simply because most of the content on my website will be photographic images, which I have 
not gotten around to taking and editing. I am not sure if putting the hypertext links into 
paragraphs is the correct is thing it to do if I want the linked tabs to be ultimately 
displayed at the top of the page, but for now that's what I did. I am guessing that I can 
place them at the top of the page eventually through CSS.
